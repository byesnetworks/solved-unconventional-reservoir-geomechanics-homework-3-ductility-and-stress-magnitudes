<h1>Instructions</h1>

This assignment focuses the relationship between the viscoplastic properties (ductility) of reservoir rocks and the state of stress in different lithofacies.

<h1>Part 1: Creep and stress relaxation</h1>

Sone &amp; Zoback (2013b) describe the time-dependent deformation (creep) in terms of a viscoelastic power law with the form (Unit 7, slide 10):

<ol>

 <li>What do the power law parameters <em>B </em>and <em>n </em>represent? How do they vary with clay + TOC? sample orientation? elastic stiffness?</li>

 <li>Consider the following samples: Barnett-2, Haynesville-1 and Eagle Ford-1 (vertical samples). Using the lower limits of <em>B </em>and <em>n </em>values provided in Table 1, calculate the amount of creep strain, , that would occur due to the application of 30 MPa differential stress over times of 1 yr, 100 kyr, and 100 Myr. Construct a table of the results and/or a scatter plot of the creep strain as a function of time with the points colored based on the clay + TOC.</li>

 <li>What is the relationship between the amount of creep strain and clay + TOC?</li>

 <li>The creep compliance function <em>J</em>(<em>t</em>) of the viscoelastic power law model is given by:</li>

</ol>

<em>J</em>(<em>t</em>) = <em>Bt<sup>n</sup></em>

Plot log <em>J</em>(<em>t</em>) versus log <em>t </em>for each sample and show how the values of <em>B </em>and <em>n </em>are obtained.

<ol>

 <li>For each sample, calculate the accumulated differential stress, <em>σ</em>(<em>t</em>), for a constant strain rate of over 150 My using the following expression:</li>

</ol>

<h1>Part 2: Effects of viscoplastic creep on stress magnitudes</h1>

<ol>

 <li>For a normal faulting environment, calculate the lower bound on the least principal stress using the following parameters:</li>

</ol>

Depth, <em>d </em>= 9000 ft

Coefficient of friction, <em>µ </em>= 0.6

Pore pressure gradient = 0.5 psi/ft

Vertical stress, <em>S</em><sub>v </sub>= 1.1 psi/ft

<ol>

 <li>Viscoplastic stress relaxation. The variation in differential stress with time is given by the expression below (Unit 7, slide 17):</li>

</ol>

where <sub>0</sub>, the total strain, is a fitting parameter. What is = 100 Myr for <em>E </em>= 40 GPa? Use the plot below to find the value of <em>n </em>from the linear fit line.

<ol>

 <li>How much would you expect the value of <em>S<sub>hmin </sub></em>to evolve due to viscoplastic stress relaxation? Use <em>t </em>= 100 Myr and the upper/lower bound values of <em>n </em>to determine the range of <em>S<sub>hmin </sub></em></li>

</ol>

<h1>Part 3: Vertical growth of hydraulic fractures in layered media</h1>

<ol>

 <li>Figure 3 shows <em>S<sub>hmin </sub></em>magnitudes as a function of depth for a layered sequence. Based on this stress profile, which formation is the least ductile (most brittle)?</li>

 <li>Assuming a strike-slip faulting regime, which layer would you stimulate to achieve a wide, confined fracture with limited vertical extent?</li>

 <li>Suppose that stimulating layer E results in horizontal hydraulic fractures. What does this tell you about the relative stress magnitudes in layer E?</li>

</ol>
